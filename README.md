## Data analysis and visualization: English Premier League & UEFA Champions League Winner  2018-19

English Premier League is top division domestic league played in England whereas UEFA Champions League is league knockout competition which is played by top teams across Europe.

The 2018-19 English Premier league finished very close in terms of points with eventual champions Manchester City finishing with 98 points and 2nd placed Liverpool finishing second with 97 points. Liverpool went on to win the Champions League in that season.

In this analysis, I have tried to analyze  Man City and Liverpool player attributes from the Fifa 19 dataset(courtesy: https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19). Premier league and Champions League is gruelling in terms of number of matches and close competition which demands high fitness and expensive players.

*This data analysis and visualization aims to answer the following aspects while comparing Manchester City and Liverpool players

* **Physical attribute**: Comparing the stamina of both the teams with various paramters like BMI, Overall to ascertain the readiness of the players for a long season. 
* **Cost effectiveness** Comparing the Wages for the players to assess how much money was spent in wages to acheive the results.
* **Home talent** Ratio of home and foreign players in the respective team to assess how much importance do the club give to groom players for national team
* **Playing Attribute** Positioning and composure of the players from both the teams.



#Conclusion

**Physical Attribute**
BMI of almost all the players from both the team is in the healthy range of 18-25. It can be infered that players from both the teams 
have maintained their weight in accordance to their height.
Stamina vs BMI is too scattered to draw any sort of inference.


**Cost effectiveness**
Man City and Liverpool finished very close in the points table with Man City winning the English Premier League with one point difference. 
Liverpool not only finished second in the league but went on to win the Champions League.
Looking at the wage distribution in terms of mean, median, max, standard deviation along with total money spent it is quite clear that Man City 
have invested far more money than Liverpool. Man CIty winning the league justifies the money they have spent but on a larger scale it does not seems to be cost effective.


**Playing Attribute**
Playing attribute viz. Composure and Positioning is roughly same for both the teams. There is not much difference between in the distribution of the two attributes under study.
