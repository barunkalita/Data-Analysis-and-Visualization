English Premier League is top division domestic league played in England whereas UEFA Champions League is league knockout competition which is played by top teams across Europe.

The 2018-19 English Premier league finished very close in terms of points with eventual champions Manchester City finishing with 98 points and 2nd placed Liverpool finishing second with 97 points. Liverpool went on to win the Champions League in that season.

In this analysis, I have tried to analyze  Man City and Liverpool player attributes from the Fifa 19 dataset(courtesy: https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19). Premier league and Champions League is gruelling in terms of number of matches and close competition which demands high fitness and expensive players.

*This data analysis and visualization aims to answer the following aspects while comparing Manchester City and Liverpool players

* **Physical attribute**: Correlation between Body Mass Index of the players and stamina to asses how much prepration goes behind in keeping the player ready to meet phsical demands of a long season.
